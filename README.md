# raylib ttf anti aliased rust demo

This is just another simple test project showing a vertical font scrolling with anti aliased font. 
Programmed in Rust using the raylib-rs crate. I started this project a few days after I finished it in C++ to see both 
languages in comparison.

- Font provided by Font Space (https://www.fontspace.com/trueno-font-f22345)
- raylib 3.7.0 (https://crates.io/crates/raylib)
